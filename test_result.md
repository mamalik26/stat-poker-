# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Console logs consistently show 'Can calculate: false' indicating the canCalculate logic (App.js line 113) is not working properly. The issue is in React state management between PokerTable and App components - the onCardsChange callback is not properly updating currentCards state, causing the button to stay disabled instead of becoming enabled (green). This breaks the core functionality of the poker calculator as users cannot access probability analysis after card selection. Root cause: handleHoleCardSelect in PokerTable calls onCardsChange, but currentCards state in App component is not updating correctly."

        - comment: "❌ BUG STILL EXISTS AFTER useCallback REMOVAL: Despite removing useCallback dependencies from handleCardsChange, handlePlayersChange, and handleCalculate functions, the critical bug persists. DETAILED ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The issue is in the card position logic in PokerTable.js. When selecting the second hole card, the console shows 'Hole card selected: {rank: K, suit: spades, id: K_spades} at position: 0' - the second card is being placed at position 0 instead of position 1, overwriting the first card. This results in 'Calling onCardsChange with: [Object, null]' showing only 1 card instead of 2. The canCalculate logic correctly evaluates to false because currentCards.holeCards.filter(Boolean).length equals 1, not 2. VISUAL CONFIRMATION: Screenshot shows King of Spades in first card slot, but second slot still shows 'Add' button, confirming the second card selection overwrote the first card. The bug is NOT in the useCallback dependencies but in the CardSelector component's position parameter passing to handleHoleCardSelect function."

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) Successfully logged in and navigated to calculator ✅ 2) Initial state correct - Calculate button disabled (gray) ✅ 3) CRITICAL ISSUE: When selecting second hole card (King of Hearts), console shows 'Hole card selected: {rank: K, suit: hearts, id: K_hearts} at position: 0' - the second card overwrites the first card at position 0 instead of being placed at position 1. 4) Console shows 'Calling onCardsChange with: [Object, null]' indicating only 1 card instead of 2. 5) 'Can calculate: false' persists because only 1 card is actually stored. 6) Calculate button remains disabled (gray) instead of becoming enabled (green). VISUAL EVIDENCE: Screenshot shows King of Hearts in first card slot, but second slot still shows 'Add' button, confirming the position parameter bug. ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: The CardSelector component is not properly passing the correct position index to handleHoleCardSelect function in PokerTable.js.

        - comment: "🔍 ENHANCED DEBUG TEST COMPLETED: Conducted comprehensive debug testing with detailed console logging to identify the exact cause of the card position indexing bug. KEY FINDINGS: 1) RENDERING ANALYSIS: Console logs confirm both hole cards render correctly with proper indices - 'Rendering hole card at index: 0 card: null' and 'Rendering hole card at index: 1 card: null'. This proves the map function in PokerTable.js (lines 147-178) correctly passes index parameters to each CardSelector. 2) CLOSURE ANALYSIS: The CardSelector callback closure appears correct - onCardSelect={(selectedCard) => { handleHoleCardSelect(selectedCard, index); }} properly captures the index variable. 3) MISSING DEBUG LOGS: Expected logs 'CardSelector callback called for index: X' and 'Hole card selected: ... at position: X' were not captured due to session management issues, but code analysis shows the bug is likely in CardSelector component's callback execution rather than closure capture. 4) ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS: The position parameter corruption occurs in the CardSelector component's handleCardSelect method (CardSelector.js line 41-44) or in the React event handling, not in the PokerTable closure logic. 5) TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATION: The bug requires investigation of CardSelector's onCardSelect callback execution and potential React re-rendering issues causing stale closures. The issue is confirmed to exist but the exact corruption point needs further debugging in the CardSelector component itself."

    - message: "Completed comprehensive backend API testing. Found critical bug in treys library integration that breaks flop/turn analysis. The _evaluate_current_hand() method calls evaluator.evaluate() with incomplete boards, but treys requires exactly 5 cards. This affects any scenario with <5 community cards. Also found minor issues with error handling for invalid card formats. Performance is acceptable but could be optimized. 9/14 tests passed overall."

    - message: "MAJOR PROGRESS: Fixed critical treys library integration issues! 🎉 Priority test results: 5/6 passed (83.3%). ✅ FIXED: Flop analysis with incomplete board (87.34% win, straight detected), Turn analysis (73.7% win, straight detected), Invalid card format validation (proper 400 errors), Hand strength analysis (made/drawing hands), Monte Carlo accuracy (consistent results). ❌ REMAINING: Performance optimization needed - high iteration tests take 5-10s instead of target <5s. Fixed _check_straight_potential() bug that was causing 500 errors. Overall backend functionality is now working correctly with only performance tuning needed."

    - message: "🚨 CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: Calculator Card Selection Bug! ❌ ISSUE: The Calculate Probabilities button remains DISABLED (gray) even after selecting 2 hole cards, preventing users from running probability calculations. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Console logs consistently show 'Can calculate: false' even when cards should be selected. The issue is in the state management between PokerTable and App components. The onCardsChange callback (App.js line 37-41) and canCalculate logic (App.js line 113) are not working properly. The handleHoleCardSelect function in PokerTable calls onCardsChange, but the currentCards state in App component is not updating correctly, causing canCalculate to remain false. 🎯 IMPACT: Users cannot access the core functionality of the poker calculator - probability analysis is completely blocked after card selection. This is a critical user experience bug that breaks the primary feature of the application. 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS: The bug is in the React state management flow where card selection events are not properly propagating from PokerTable to App component, preventing the Calculate button from becoming enabled (green) as expected."

    - message: "🚨 CRITICAL BUG RE-TEST COMPLETED: Calculator Card Selection Bug STILL EXISTS! ❌ DETAILED FINDINGS: Despite removing useCallback dependencies from handleCardsChange, handlePlayersChange, and handleCalculate functions, the critical bug persists. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The issue is NOT in useCallback but in the card position logic in PokerTable.js. When selecting the second hole card, console shows 'Hole card selected: {rank: K, suit: spades, id: K_spades} at position: 0' - the second card is being placed at position 0 instead of position 1, overwriting the first card. This results in 'Calling onCardsChange with: [Object, null]' showing only 1 card instead of 2. VISUAL CONFIRMATION: Screenshot shows King of Spades in first card slot, but second slot still shows 'Add' button, confirming the second card selection overwrote the first card. IMPACT: canCalculate logic correctly evaluates to false because currentCards.holeCards.filter(Boolean).length equals 1, not 2. Calculate button remains gray/disabled. TECHNICAL SOLUTION NEEDED: Fix the CardSelector component's position parameter passing to handleHoleCardSelect function in PokerTable.js. The bug is in the card slot indexing, not React state management."

Initial state correct with Calculate button disabled. CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED: When selecting second hole card (King of Hearts), console shows 'Hole card selected: {rank: K, suit: hearts, id: K_hearts} at position: 0' - the second card overwrites the first card at position 0 instead of being placed at position 1. Console shows 'Calling onCardsChange with: [Object, null]' indicating only 1 card stored instead of 2. 'Can calculate: false' persists because currentCards.holeCards.filter(Boolean).length equals 1, not 2. Calculate button remains disabled (gray). VISUAL EVIDENCE: Screenshot shows King of Hearts in first card slot, but second slot still shows 'Add' button. ROOT CAUSE: CardSelector component position parameter bug in PokerTable.js - the closure is not properly capturing the correct index position for the second hole card. This critical bug prevents users from accessing core poker calculator functionality. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must fix the position parameter passing in CardSelector callbacks to ensure proper card slot indexing."

MISSING CRITICAL LOGS ❌: Expected debug logs 'CardSelector callback called for index: X' and 'Hole card selected: ... at position: X' were not captured due to session management issues during testing, but code analysis reveals the bug location. 4) ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS 🎯: The position parameter corruption occurs in the CardSelector component's handleCardSelect method (CardSelector.js line 41-44) or in React event handling, NOT in the PokerTable closure logic. The rendering logs prove the closure captures correct indices. 5) TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATION 🔧: The bug requires investigation of CardSelector's onCardSelect callback execution and potential React re-rendering issues causing stale closures. The main agent should focus debugging efforts on the CardSelector component's callback mechanism rather than the PokerTable mapping logic. The issue is confirmed to exist but the exact corruption point is in CardSelector component execution, not closure capture."
